# Covid19_Predictions

In this project, I conducted an analysis using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to understand the impact of different symptoms of Covid-19 on the probability of a person's death. I utilized the Random Forest and Neural Network algorithms for supervised learning and the k-Means and Mean-Shift algorithms for unsupervised learning. The results showed that both Random Forest and Neural Network were effective in predicting patient mortality, with the Neural Network outperforming the Random Forest. Additionally, the k-Means algorithm proved to be the most suitable for clustering patients into different categories based on similar characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights into risk factors and clinical characteristics of Covid-19 patients, which can aid in improving medical care and reducing mortality rates.
